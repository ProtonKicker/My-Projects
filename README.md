hi~~
this is going to be my 1st post on github!

yesterday I googled a little.

The so said "carbon fiber filaments" in the market contain chopped fiber. The fibers can boost the overall strength of filaments. 
However, they can be stronger if they used continuous fiber instead.

I found one online, and its link is here: https://markforged.com/materials/continuous-fibers/continuous-carbon-fiber


this is EXPANSIVE! 
it is sold for $150 per 50cc. this is horribly expansive!
BUT
in the link provided, it is as strong as aluminum!
this is literally insane!

that might be extremely useful for tinkers who are looking for extremely robust filaments and creating functional prototypes

PS:
I'm not selling this nor having this brand as a sponser. I just found this product online and felt like it is really interesting and decide to share
